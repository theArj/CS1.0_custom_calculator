# This custom calculator will help aspiring guitarists choose which type of guitar
# would be best for them based on the type of music they like.

# Some recommendations are as follows:
# "Fender Stratocaster" for classic rock and blues, like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix
# "Fender Telecaster" for country
# "Gibson Les Paul" for hard rock, like Led Zeppelin and Guns 'N Roses

# Alternatively, write a program that gives 4 choices of artists numbered 1 - 4, and
# assign a guitar to each artist. Based on the artist choice by entering the respective
# number, the result will be the appropriate guitar.
