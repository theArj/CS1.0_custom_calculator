# This custom calculator will help aspiring guitarists choose which type of guitar
# would be best for them based on the type of music they like.

# Some recommendations are as follows:
# "Fender Stratocaster" for classic rock and blues, like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix
# "Fender Telecaster" for country
# "Gibson Les Paul" for hard rock, like Led Zeppelin and Guns 'N Roses

# Alternatively, write a program that gives 4 choices of artists numbered 1 - 4, and
# assign a guitar to each artist. Based on the artist choice by entering the respective
# number, the result will be the appropriate guitar.

# Scenario: You love music and have dreams of being a rockstar! But you don't know where to start.
# Enter, the Custom Guitar Calculator! Simply, you are given several choices of world famous
# guitar players in different genres to choose your favorite. Based on your favorite choice, the
# Custom Guitar Calculator will provide you with the perfect options for you.

# <--- Include an print statement welcoming the user to the Custom Guitar Calculator and asking for their name. --->

# <--- Upon user entering their name, greet them with a friendly greeting using the username, then ask
#   the user to choose from the list of 4 options printed on the screen:
#       1. Eric Clapton/Jimi Hendrix: Fender Stratocaster
#       2. Brad Paisley/Keith Urban: Fender Telecaster
#       3. Led Zeppelin/Guns N' Roses: Gibson Les Paul
#       4. Kirk Hammett/Joe Satriani: ESP or Ibanez

# Rubric: Input - Prompt the user to enter at least two numeric values that will be used in the calculation.

# Perhaps, assign a number to a genre and assign a number to an artist from that genre.
# Here are some genre and choices within those genres as examples:
#       1. Rock/Blues
#           1. Eric Clapton: Fender Stratocaster
#           2. Jimi Page: Gibson Les Paul
#       2. Country
#           1. Keith Urban: Fender Telecaster
#           2. Brad Paisley: Fender Telecaster
#       3. Jazz
#           1. Les Paul: Gibson Les Paul
#           2. Wes Montgomery: Gibson L5-CES

# Because two numerical values are needed, a second alternative idea is to calculate the monthly payments for
# a product based on their budget and the number of monthly payments they'd like to make at 0% interest to
# pay it off.
